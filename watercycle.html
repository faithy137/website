	<h1>Water(H2O)</h1>
	Water is a unique substance that exhibits different behaviors in its three states:
	solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor).
	Here's a detailed look at each state:</br>
	<br>Water behaves differently in its three states:</br>
	<ol>
	<li><b>Solid (Ice):</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Molecules are tightly packed in a fixed, orderly arrangement.</li>
	<li>Ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats.</li>
	<li>It has a fixed shape and volume.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Liquid (Water):</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Molecules are close together but can move around, allowing water to flow.</li>
	<li>It takes the shape of its container but has a fixed volume.</li>
	<li>It has surface tension, which makes it bead up on surfaces.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Gas (Water Vapor):</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Molecules are far apart and move freely.</li>
	<li>It fills the entire space of its container.</li>
	<li>It is invisible and can spread out easily.</li>
	</ul>
	</ol>
	<h3>Phase Transitions</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Melting:</b>Solid ice turns into liquid water when heated to 0°C (32°F).</li>
	<li><b>Freezing:</b>Liquid water turns into solid ice when cooled below 0°C (32°F).</li>
	<li><b>Vaporization:</b>Liquid water turns into water vapor when heated to 100°C (212°F) at standard atmospheric pressure.</li>
	<li><b>Condensation:</b>Water vapor turns into liquid water when cooled.</li>
	<li><b>Sublimation:</b>Solid ice turns directly into water vapor without passing through the liquid phase (e.g., in dry ice).</li>
	<li><b>Deposition:</b>Water vapor turns directly into solid ice without passing through the liquid phase (e.g., frost formation).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Unique Properties of Water</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>High Specific Heat Capacity:</b>Water can absorb a lot of heat without a significant increase in temperature. This property moderates Earth's climate and helps organisms regulate body temperature.</li>
	<li><b>Anomalous Expansion:</b>Water expands upon freezing, unlike most substances, which contract. This property is crucial for aquatic life in cold climates, as it prevents entire bodies of water from freezing solid.</li>
	</ul>
	Water's unique behaviors in different states are primarily due to its hydrogen bonding and molecular structure. These properties have significant implications for the environment, weather, and life on Earth.<br>

	<h1>HYDROLOGIC CYCLE OR WATER CYCLE</h1>
	The water cycle is essential for sustaining life on Earth, distributing heat, regulating climate, and supporting ecosystems. It is a closed system, with no beginning or end, and it ensures the continuous movement and availability of water across different reservoirs.</br>
	<br>Water's role in the water cycle can be simply summarized as follows:</br>
	
	<ol>
	<li><b>Evaporation</b>Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere.</li>
	<li><b>Condensation:</b>Water vapor cools and forms clouds.</li>
	<li><b>Precipitation:</b>Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, returning to the Earth's surface.</li>
	<li><b>Collection:</b>Water collects in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans, and some seeps into the ground, replenishing groundwater.</li>
	<li><b>Repeat:</b>The cycle then repeats, continuously circulating water throughout the Earth's systems.</li>
	</ol>
