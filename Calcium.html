        Other Sources: <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Calcium-Fortified Water: Some bottled water brands add calcium.</li>
            <li>Calcium-Rich Snacks: Some snacks, like certain granola bars and crackers, are fortified with calcium.</li>
		</p>
		<p>
        <b> How do we use Calcium? </b>
		<ol>
<li>Take calcium citrate with or without food. Take calcium carbonate with food. The acid the stomach makes while eating helps the body absorb calcium carbonate1.</li>
<li>It is best to take calcium in smaller doses. Smaller doses most often means 500 milligrams or less at a time.</li>
<li>You can consume calcium from foods or supplements, or by using calcium that already exists in the body by taking it from bones. 
The calcium that is "borrowed" from the bones should ideally be replaced by eating high-calcium foods.</li>
<li>People commonly take calcium by mouth for the treatment and prevention of low calcium levels, muscle cramps, osteoporosis, softening of the bones, and PMS. 
It is also used for high blood pressure, cancer, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.</li>
</ol>
Tips for Optimal Use:
<ul>
<li>Balance with Other Nutrients: Ensure a balanced intake of other nutrients like magnesium and phosphorus, which are important for bone health.</li>
<li>Avoid Excessive Intake: Excessive calcium intake can lead to health issues, including kidney stones and cardiovascular problems. 
Stick to recommended daily amounts unless otherwise advised by a healthcare professional.</li>
</ul>
Recommended Daily Intake: <br/>
The recommended daily intake of calcium varies by age, gender, and life stage. For example:
<ul>
<li>Adults (19-50 years): Around 1,000 mg/day</li>
<li>Women over 50 and men over 70: 1,200 mg/day</li>
<li>Teens (9-18 years): 1,300 mg/d</li>
