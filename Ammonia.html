	<b> What is Ammonia? </b>
	</p>
	<p>
    Ammonia is a colorless, pungent gas with the formula NH3, composed of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is the simplest stable compound of these elements and a common nitrogenous waste in nature. It dissolves readily in water and can be stored as a liquid at high pressure. It is used as a fertilizer and a starting material for many nitrogen compounds. It is also produced by bacteria in the intestines when digesting protein and processed in the liver into urea.
    </p>
	<p>
    <b> Why is it important? </b>
Ammonia is important for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>It serves as a chemical building block for commercial and household products, including fertilizers and cleaning supplies.</li>
<li>It is used as a refrigerant, stabilizer, neutralizer, and purifier in food transport and water treatment.</li>
<li>Mass production of ammonia has improved crop yields and sustained a large population by making fertilizers.</li>
<li>It is used in the manufacturing of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes, and other chemicals.</li>
</ul>

<b> Where to find it? </b>
Ammonia can be found in the following places:
<ul>
<li>Naturally in the environment, including air, soil, water, plants, and animals.</li>
<li>As a byproduct of biological processes by bacteria in soil and water.</li>
<li>In industrial production through the Haber-Bosch process.</li>
<li>In fertilizers and pharmaceuticals</li>
</ul>

<b> How to use Ammonia </b>
To use ammonia for cleaning, you can follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Mix Â¼ cup of ammonia with 1 gallon of water to create a mildew-killing solution. Spray it on mildewed surfaces, let it sit for 15 minutes, and then wipe with a clean cloth.</li>
<li>For glass and mirrors, mix one part clear household ammonia with 10 parts water. Wipe down the surface with the solution and a clean cloth or squeegee.</li>
<li>For stained clothing, use a half-strength solution of ammonia and water to remove perspiration, blood, urine, and pencil marks before laundering.</li>
</ol>
